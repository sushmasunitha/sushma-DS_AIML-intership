    "Machine Learning is a method of teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of explicitly programming rules. In traditional programming, we give the computer both data and rules to produce an output. However, in Machine Learning, we provide the computer with data and expected outputs, and it automatically learns the rules or patterns that connect them. This shift allows systems to improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data. Machine Learning is widely used in applications such as spam detection, image recognition, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars."
